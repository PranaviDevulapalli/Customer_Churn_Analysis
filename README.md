Customer Churn Analysis Project

Goal: Build a Customer Churn Analysis model from start to finish, analyzing customer behavior and predicting churn using machine learning.

---

Project Overview

This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset to build a predictive model that determines whether a customer is likely to churn. It covers data exploration, cleaning, and building a machine learning model using logistic regression.

Tools & Technologies

- Python: The main programming language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and tools.
- Git & GitHub: Version control and code collaboration.

Steps Taken

1. Project Setup & GitHub Initialization
- Created a GitHub repository to track and share the project.
- Initialized a local Git repository and set up the development environment.

2. Load & Explore Dataset
- Downloaded and loaded the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset.
- Performed basic data exploration to understand the structure of the dataset.

3. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns.
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical format.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of churn.
- Identified important features influencing churn using correlation and visual analysis.

5. Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

6. Visualize Insights
- Created visualizations to highlight key insights from the data, such as churn rates by contract type.
